Part 1:
Implement (use Python3 and numpy; the latter is a must for this part) the collaborative
filtering algorithm described in Section 2.1 of the paper (Equations 1 and 2; ignore Section
2.1.2) for making the predictions.

Part 2:
Download the MNIST dataset via scikit-learn, see below on how to do it. The dataset has a
training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples where the digits have been
centered inside 28x28 pixel images. You can also use scikit-learn to download and rescale the
dataset using the following code:
